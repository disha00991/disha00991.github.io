#### The Dreams *...under construction*

- I need to understand the planet and its people more. Visit more than my own country and make sense of what's going on that we need military? We know we have land to live and we do not have to encroach on others' land. Why the threatening of military? Where will we go with the Rafael or the MIG-xyz?

- I wish to open a start up in future which somehow manages to get healthy, untouched left over food which although doesn't meet their demand of high class food, can fill hundreds of empty stomach roaming around. Considering my country India ranking among the highest in hunger. Also a country where people throw homemade food and order from Swiggy because the cook forgot to put some salt perhaps!

- I need to spread the already diffused and lost word: STOP wasting food. We cut trees to grow crops that we don't eat. We don't allow water to seep by building concrete roads and complain about groundwater shortage, yet we are more excited about researching how a robot can have sensitive skin than how roads can be made with a material that allows for water seepage. -_- !

- Our ancestors have given us this beautiful planet by consistently identifying the REAL problems around and solving things meticulously. But today, it seems that we have stopped digging into problems. My absolutely personal opinion: We are overly spoilt and want cheap luxuries moving forward than worrying about basic necessities that will bother us in future if not seen today. Can you play with your robot puppy in the dirty blizzard of carbon blowing outside your house?

I am sure there are a few things I miss every time I come to update this page, but once, at least some of these things are true, I'll transfer these to a novel and right without restriction. As I said, <br/>

#### Some mediocre mandatory dreams
*May / May not become true based on time/money/space complexity of solution thereupon*
- A small rocky hut in a hilly mountaineous location for my kids' vacation
- At least one live encounter of the Aurora in the skies of Alaska
- Banning Dolphin Shows, zoo culture and releasing all these "Î²" creatures together into the wild.
