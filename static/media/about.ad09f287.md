#### Getting Subjective...
I am a Graduate student pursuing **Masters in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst**. With 3 years of experience in the IT industry, I have a knack for Software Development and understand the aspects of working in a cross functional team, collaborating together or delivering features independently.

<br/>
I like philosophizing about vague conventions, human behaviours, climate change, end of the world and so on. It sometimes bewilders me how the concept of money is just virtual: a random number in each of our banks, and still holds the power to decide what resources of this planet will "BELONG" to whom. Then I stop, and begin reading *The Kite Runner* by Khaled Hosseini for the fifth time. Peace.

#### Currently
I am **building skills in the Data Science domain**, working on projects with such knowledgeable batchmates and mentors. I just completed my Internship with the Data Science for the Common Good and **looking for full time or internship roles starting Summer 2022**.

#### Some history

- I have been a part of an extremely lovable family, parents who taught me every detail of kindness, selflessness and brought me up showing how to live a frugal life while still having everything one needs. Most importantly, garnering happiness from showing care.

- At 26, this personality has transformed into caring for the whole planet. Although, I have come to terms with the fact that I alone cannot change every problem on earth and it's okay. Yet, I can do my own bit. You see, it's not enough but that's all I can do and urge others to do the same. Work. Inspire. Work.

- I realized quite late in my life that **Computer Science alone can change the face of this earth**, once people forget about revenues and build technology for the planet: which ultimately implies technology for our own beautiful future. But, who will be so short-term-selfless-long-term-selfish? I think I will. But but. First I have to prove my powers to my parents, to this world by becoming a leader in this field. So that my care for the planet, is not confused with mediocrity. This attention is a big need. A call of the future. Atleast in my opinion. My belief.
