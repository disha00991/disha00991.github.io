#### Intro
I am a B.Tech graduate with 2 years of experience in the IT industry. My primary job functions are as a software developer. But I've always felt that I was not born to do just one sort of work. I am sure, I feel different from the rest, as not many people I share my thoughts with, connect with me. 
<br/><hr/>
I like philosophizing about vague conventions, human behaviours, climate change, end of the world and so on. It sometimes bewilders me how the concept of money is just virtual: a random number in each of our banks, and still holds the power to decide what resources of this planet will "BELONG" to whom. Then I stop, and begin reading *The Kite Runner* by Khaled Hosseini for the fifth time. Peace.

#### Currently
I am on a learning spree while being at work, meaning -> I am pretty fortunate. I do what my heart likes, not to mention, I watch any movie, without facing judgement from anyone. Lately, the extremity of getting inspired from each movie I see has heightened. I feel as if my brain has developed exponentially in a short span of time and its astonishing to start seeing the world so differently all of a sudden.
<hr/>
Following this: all my childhood thoughts have started to gain shape and I like to believe that out of zillions of humans at least I am one those who will make these things a reality one day.

#### Some history

- I have been a part of an extremely lovable family, parents who taught me every detail of kindness, selflessness and brought me up showing how to live a frugal life while still having everything one needs. Most importantly, garnering happiness from showing care.

- At 24, this personality has transformed into caring for the whole planet. Although, I have come to terms with the fact that I alone cannot change every problem on earth and it's okay. Yet, I can do my own bit. You see, it's not enough but that's all I can do and urge others to do the same. Work. Inspire. Work.

- I realized quite late in my life that **Computer Science alone can change the face of this earth**, once people forget about revenues and build technology for the planet: which ultimately implies technology for our own beautiful future. But, who will be so short-term-selfless-long-term-selfish? I think I will. But but. First I have to prove my powers to my parents, to this world by becoming a leader in this field. So that my care for the planet, is not confused with mediocrity. This attention is a big need. A call of the future. Atleast in my opinion. My belief.
