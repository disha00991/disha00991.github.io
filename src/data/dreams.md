#### Intro
I am a B.Tech graduate with 2 years of experience in the IT industry. My primary job functions are as a software developer. But I've always felt that I was not born to do just one sort of work. I am sure, I feel different from the rest, as not many people I share my thoughts with, connect with me. 
<br/><hr/>
I like philosophizing about vague conventions, human behaviours, climate change, end of the world and so on. It sometimes bewilders me how the concept of money is just virtual: a random number in each of our banks, and still holds the power to decide what resources of this planet will "BELONG" to whom. Then I stop, and begin reading *The Kite Runner* by Khaled Hosseini for the fifth time. Peace.

#### Currently
I am on a learning spree while being at work, meaning -> I am pretty fortunate. I do what my heart likes, not to mention, I watch any movie, without facing judgement from anyone. Lately, the extremity of getting inspired from each movie I see has heightened. I feel as if my brain has developed exponentially in a short span of time and its astonishing to start seeing the world so differently all of a sudden.
<hr/>
Following this: all my childhood thoughts have started to gain shape and I like to believe that out of zillions of humans at least I am one those who will make these things a reality one day.

#### Some history

- I have been a part of an extremely lovable family, parents who taught me every detail of kindness, selflessness and brought me up showing how to live a frugal life while still having everything one needs. Most importantly, garnering happiness from showing care.

- At 24, this personality has transformed into caring for the whole planet. Although, I have come to terms with the fact that I alone cannot change every problem on earth and it's okay. Yet, I can do my own bit. You see, it's not enough but that's all I can do and urge others to do the same. Work. Inspire. Work.

- I realized quite late in my life that **Computer Science alone can change the face of this earth**, once people forget about revenues and build technology for the planet: which ultimately implies technology for our own beautiful future. But, who will be so short-term-selfless-long-term-selfish? I think I will. But but. First I have to prove my powers to my parents, to this world by becoming a leader in this field. So that my care for the planet, is not confused with mediocrity. This attention is a big need. A call of the future. Atleast in my opinion. My belief.

#### The Dreams *...under construction*

- I need to understand the planet and its people more. Visit more than my own country and make sense of what's going on that we need military? We know we have land to live and we do not have to encroach on others' land. Why the threatening of military? Where will we go with the Rafael or the MIG-xyz?

- I wish to open a start up in future which somehow manages to get healthy, untouched left over food which although doesn't meet their demand of high class food, can fill hundreds of empty stomach roaming around. Considering my country India ranking among the highest in hunger. Also a country where people throw homemade food and order from Swiggy because the cook forgot to put some salt perhaps!

- I need to spread the already diffused and lost word: STOP wasting food. We cut trees to grow crops that we don't eat. We don't allow water to seep by building concrete roads and complain about groundwater shortage, yet we are more excited about researching how a robot can have sensitive skin than how roads can be made with a material that allows for water seepage. -_- !

- Our ancestors have given us this beautiful planet by consistently identifying the REAL problems around and solving things meticulously. But today, it seems that we have stopped digging into problems. My absolutely personal opinion: We are overly spoilt and want cheap luxuries moving forward than worrying about basic necessities that will bother us in future if not seen today. Can you play with your robot puppy in the dirty blizzard of carbon blowing outside your house?

I am sure there are a few things I miss every time I come to update this page, but once, at least some of these things are true, I'll transfer these to a novel and right without restriction. As I said, <br/>
*One becomes worthy of a listener's time only once he holds credibility for his words.*
<hr/>

#### Some mediocre mandatory dreams
*May/maynot become true based on time/money/space complexity of solution thereupon*
- A small rocky hut in a hilly mountaineous location for my kids' vacation
- At least one live encounter of the Aurora in the skies of Alaska
- Banning Dolphin Shows, zoo culture and releasing all these "Î²" creatures together into the wild.
