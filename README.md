## This website was born when I woke up one day & thought that it's as necessary as my breakfast!

Feel free to clone and use as template.<br />
Just open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Acknowledgements

* Special thanks to gh-pages for letting me host my tech website free of cost, that too with a domain name<br/>
  that isn't a bit less cooler than those I could pay for!
* Template based on [Future Imperfect](https://html5up.net/future-imperfect) by [@ajlkn](https://github.com/ajlkn) for [HTML5 UP](html5up.net).
* And ofc as you can tell: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
